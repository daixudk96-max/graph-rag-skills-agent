# Delta for slash-command-system

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: CLI Init Command for Slash Commands
The system SHALL provide a `skill-seekers init` CLI command that generates AI coding assistant workflow files for slash commands.

#### Scenario: Initialize for Antigravity
- **GIVEN** the user runs `skill-seekers init --tools antigravity`
- **WHEN** the command executes in a project directory
- **THEN** the system creates `.agent/workflows/skill-seekers-proposal.md`
- **AND** the system creates `.agent/workflows/skill-seekers-apply.md`
- **AND** the system creates `.agent/workflows/skill-seekers-archive.md`
- **AND** each file contains frontmatter with description and workflow steps

#### Scenario: Initialize for all supported tools
- **GIVEN** the user runs `skill-seekers init --tools all`
- **WHEN** the command executes
- **THEN** the system creates workflow files for all 20+ supported AI tools
- **AND** each tool's files are placed in the correct directory (e.g., `.agent/workflows/` for Antigravity, `.claude/commands/` for Claude Code)

#### Scenario: Interactive tool selection
- **GIVEN** the user runs `skill-seekers init` without `--tools`
- **WHEN** the command executes
- **THEN** the system prompts the user to select which AI tools to configure
- **AND** only selected tools receive workflow files

### Requirement: CLI Update Command
The system SHALL provide a `skill-seekers update` CLI command that updates existing workflow files with the latest templates.

#### Scenario: Update existing workflows
- **GIVEN** workflow files were previously generated by `skill-seekers init`
- **WHEN** the user runs `skill-seekers update`
- **THEN** the system updates only the managed block (between SKILL_SEEKERS markers) in each file
- **AND** user customizations outside the managed block are preserved

### Requirement: Slash Command Workflow Templates
The system SHALL provide three slash command workflows: proposal, apply, and archive, each guiding users through the Claude Skill creation process.

#### Scenario: Proposal workflow guides spec creation
- **GIVEN** the user invokes `/skill-seekers-proposal` in an AI coding assistant
- **WHEN** the assistant reads the workflow file
- **THEN** the workflow instructs the assistant to:
  - Ask user for source (URL, GitHub, PDF, transcript)
  - Select appropriate template (technical-guide, course-tutorial, etc.)
  - Run `skill-seekers scrape --spec-first --template <type>`
  - Display generated spec for user review

#### Scenario: Apply workflow builds from approved spec
- **GIVEN** the user invokes `/skill-seekers-apply` with an approved spec file
- **WHEN** the assistant reads the workflow file
- **THEN** the workflow instructs the assistant to:
  - Load the spec file path
  - Run `skill-seekers apply-spec <spec.yaml>`
  - Verify generated SKILL.md and references/
  - Report completion status

#### Scenario: Archive workflow packages completed skill
- **GIVEN** the user invokes `/skill-seekers-archive` with a completed skill
- **WHEN** the assistant reads the workflow file
- **THEN** the workflow instructs the assistant to:
  - Run `skill-seekers package <output-dir>`
  - Optionally run `skill-seekers upload` if requested
  - Move completed skill to archive location

### Requirement: Support OpenSpec-Compatible AI Tools
The system SHALL support the same set of AI coding assistants as OpenSpec, including but not limited to: Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Windsurf, RooCode, and others.

#### Scenario: Generate tool-specific file paths
- **GIVEN** the user selects "Claude Code" as target tool
- **WHEN** workflow files are generated
- **THEN** the files are placed in `.claude/commands/skill-seekers/` directory
- **AND** the filename follows Claude Code conventions

#### Scenario: Generate tool-specific frontmatter
- **GIVEN** the user selects "Antigravity" as target tool
- **WHEN** workflow files are generated
- **THEN** each file includes YAML frontmatter with `description` field
- **AND** the content follows Antigravity workflow conventions

### Requirement: AI Assistant Content Enhancement Via Workflow
The workflow SHALL guide the AI coding assistant to enhance raw scraped content, replacing the need for external LLM API calls.

#### Scenario: Proposal workflow with AI-driven enhancement
- **GIVEN** the user invokes `/skill-seekers-proposal` in an AI coding assistant
- **WHEN** the workflow executes
- **THEN** the workflow instructs the assistant to run `skill-seekers scrape --output-raw` to get raw data
- **AND** the workflow instructs the assistant to read `scraped_data.json`
- **AND** the workflow instructs the assistant to analyze and generate enhanced content (summary, key points, exercises)
- **AND** the workflow instructs the assistant to create `spec.yaml` with the enhanced content
- **AND** no external LLM API is called during this process

#### Scenario: AI assistant generates course summary
- **GIVEN** raw transcript data from a course video
- **WHEN** the AI assistant follows the proposal workflow
- **THEN** the assistant generates a 200-300 word 课程摘要
- **AND** the assistant generates 5-10 关键要点
- **AND** the assistant generates 核心概念详解
- **AND** the assistant generates 2-3 实践练习

#### Scenario: Interactive content refinement
- **GIVEN** the AI assistant has generated initial enhanced content
- **WHEN** the user requests changes (e.g., "add more examples")
- **THEN** the assistant updates the spec.yaml with refined content
- **AND** the user can iteratively improve the content through conversation

### Requirement: Output Raw Data for AI Enhancement
The system SHALL support an `--output-raw` flag that outputs raw scraped data for AI assistant consumption.

#### Scenario: Scrape with raw output
- **GIVEN** a scrape configuration file
- **WHEN** the user runs `skill-seekers scrape --config config.json --output-raw`
- **THEN** the system outputs `scraped_data.json` in the output directory
- **AND** the JSON contains structured raw content (title, body, sections, metadata)
- **AND** no LLM enhancement is applied to the data
