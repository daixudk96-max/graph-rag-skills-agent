DSA Live Integration Test
============================================================

1. Checking DSA Configuration...
   DSA_ENABLED: True
   DSA_COMPACTION_ENABLED: True

2. Setting up DSA Schema...
   Constraints created: ['community_delta_id_unique']
   Indexes created: ['community_delta_community_id', 'community_delta_created_at']
   Properties added: []
   Errors: []

3. Verifying DSA Schema...
   Community delta count: 0
   Communities with DSA props: 0

4. Testing DeltaSummarizer...
   DeltaSummarizer initialized: OK
   LLM model: ChatOpenAI

5. Testing CommunityCompactor...
   CommunityCompactor initialized: OK
   Delta count threshold: 5
   Delta token threshold: 1000

6. Checking Communities...
   Total communities: 0
